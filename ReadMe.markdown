This is pure Markdown currently. May migrate to Jekyll in the future.

Originally hosted on Dropbox; migrated here to avoid accidental change.

Files ending with `.zh.markdown` are in Chinese; the rest in English. English
files are wrapped at 80 so that pure sources are still readable, while Chinese
ones are not (since this would create an extra space on webpage).

GitHub Flavored Markdown is used.
