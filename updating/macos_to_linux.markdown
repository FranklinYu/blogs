# macOS to Linux

I havenâ€™t migrate my main workstation to Linux because:

 1. [**high**] Need cloud synchronization software like Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive.
 1. [**high**] Need music softwares like NetEase Music, QQ Music, and Xiami Music. Should install from [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store) or [Flathub](https://flathub.org). Spotify works as a candidate.
 1. [**medium**] Almost all mini-PCs need external Power Supply Unit. Have to build one myself, possibly with barebone from In-Win, or with all-in-one computers like [Dell OptiPlex 7760](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/desktop-and-all-in-one-pcs/optiplex-7760-all-in-one/spd/optiplex-7760-aio) or [HP EliteOne 1000](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/elite-family/eliteone-1000-aio.html).
 1. [**low**] Touchpad for Linux is more expensive.

 A potential solution is to have Windows VM for these application. [QEMU running on KVM hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU#Operating_modes) should be efficient; even gaming may be possible with [PCI passthrough](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF) (which also avoids the issue for NVidia proprietary drivers).
